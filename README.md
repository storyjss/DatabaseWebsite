# DatabaseWebsite
This is a project I worked on in my Database Class with a group where we had to create a website that communicated with a MySQL database. We decided to make a Song Database called PiQL. I mostly worked on the back end with php and mySQL. I completely made the admin_pages folder and worked with a team member on the phps folder.
